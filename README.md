# snort.conf
Config file for Snort

snort 2.9.13-WIN32 Gre (Build 15013)
snortrules.snapshot-29130.tar.gz. 
# for registered users, dont take another snapshot for this version of snort,
# because some unknown errors found

The config file is focused on Linux, so u need 2 edit for Windows.
I watched a youtube tut https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwWM0srLSg0 (Install Snort 2.9.8 on Windows)
that helps me and was playing a around, with some minor changes, to fix some errors.
# i hashtagged inside the file

Maybe it helps u snort better.
